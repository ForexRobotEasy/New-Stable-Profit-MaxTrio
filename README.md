# New Stable Profit MaxTrio

New Stable Profit MaxTrio is a multicurrency forex expert advisor (EA) developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This EA is designed to trade in the foreign exchange market, following a specific trading strategy for each currency pair.

## Features
- Multicurrency trading: The EA can trade on multiple currency pairs, including AUDCAD, GBPCAD, EURGBP, EURUSD, and AUDNZD.
- Trading parameters: The trading volume and account balance can be customized to suit individual trading preferences.
- Take-profit calculation: The EA calculates the take-profit level based on corrective movements statistics for each currency pair.
- Automatic position opening: The EA automatically opens positions for all selected currency pairs.

## How It Works
The EA uses a specific trading strategy for each currency pair to determine the optimal entry point for a trade. After identifying the entry point, the EA calculates the take-profit level based on corrective movements statistics. The trading volume is set based on the account balance to ensure appropriate risk management.

The main program entry point, `OnStart()`, is responsible for setting the trading volume based on the account balance recommendation and opening positions for all currency pairs. The `OpenPosition()` function is called for each currency pair, which in turn opens a position using the calculated take-profit level and predefined trading volume.
